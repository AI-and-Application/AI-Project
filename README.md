## Overview

Driving can be a stressful experience, especially in heavy traffic or during long commutes. **Cha-Vis** aims to transform this by acting as an AI-driven companion that not only navigates but also helps manage the driver's emotions in real-time. By analyzing speech patterns and driving behavior, Cha-Vis provides empathetic interactions, calming conversations, and personalized recommendations to ensure a safe and pleasant journey.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Safety:** Reduce the risk of accidents by monitoring and managing driver emotions.
- **Comfort:** Provide a supportive and engaging driving experience through conversational AI.
- **Efficiency:** Optimize routes based on real-time data to save time and fuel.
- **Personalization:** Tailor recommendations and interactions based on individual user preferences and behaviors.

## Features

### 1. Basic Conversations and Directions

- **Interactive Navigation:** Provides turn-by-turn directions similar to standard navigation systems.
- **Conversational Interface:** Engage in basic conversations, making the driving experience less monotonous.
- **Voice Commands:** Use voice commands to interact with the navigation system hands-free.
- **Multi-language Support:** Supports multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

**Example Interaction:**

> **User:** "How do I get to Gangnam Station?"
>
> **Cha-Vis:** "Sure, I'll guide you to Gangnam Station. In 500 meters, take a right onto Teheran-ro."

### 2. Real-time Data Collection and Analysis

- **SK Network Integration:** Utilizes SK Network to collect and analyze real-time data on traffic, weather, and local events.
- **Event Summarization:** Offers summaries of events, such as festivals or traffic incidents, with positive reviews from social media.

  **Example:**
  
  > "There's a festival ahead on your route with many positive reviews on social media. Would you like to stop by?"
  
- **Traffic Updates:** Provides real-time traffic conditions to suggest the fastest and most efficient routes.
- **Weather Alerts:** Alerts users about upcoming weather conditions that may affect driving.

### 3. Personalized Recommendation System

- **User-specific Customization:** Adapts recommendations based on individual preferences and driving habits.
- **Contextual Information:** Considers user interests, driving patterns, and destinations to provide tailored information.
- **Real-time Information Fetching:** Utilizes Google Search to reflect real-time information when necessary.

**Example:**

> "Based on your interest in coffee shops, I recommend visiting the famous Gangnam BBQ restaurant. Would you like directions?"

### 4. Emotion Recognition and Management

- **Multidimensional Emotion Analysis:** Assesses user emotions through various channels:
  - **Voice Analysis:** Real-time analysis of tone, speed, and volume changes.
  - **Language Analysis:** Examination of word choice and sentence structure.
  - **Driving Pattern Analysis:** Infers emotional state from acceleration and braking data.

- **Emotion-based Care:**
  - **Stress Detection:** Plays calming music or reduces volume, engages in soothing conversations to minimize accident risks.
  - **Emotion Coaching:** Offers simple AI-driven coaching sessions, such as guided breathing exercises or empathetic dialogues.
  
  **Example:**
  
  > "It's natural to feel angry in this situation. Please take a deep breath while I explain what's happening. We'll resolve this together."
